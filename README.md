This document is used by the KIT teams for ICPC style contests since roughly 2019.
It consists of 25 pages of copy-pasteable C++ code and one extra page with a checklist for the practice session.

## Testing
To make this document as usefull as possible we try to (automatically) stress test all code in this repository.
Non the less not all code is tested and tests might not catch every bug.
If you happen to find a bug please [open an issue](https://github.com/mzuenni/ContestReference/issues/new).
If you think code can be changed, improved or replaced also feel free to open an issue or make oben a pull request.

## Other Resources
The code in this repo has been accumulated over many years and the origin of the code is unfortunately unknown for most of the snippets.
Even though many code is written from scratch there is also plenty of code that has been copied from others and just been adjusted to our coding style.
Here is an (incomplete) list of resources that we use (besides those from previous versions):
 - https://github.com/indy256/codelibrary
 - https://github.com/spaghetti-source/algorithm
 - https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl
